# USER STORY

AS AN employee with a busy schedule.

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner.

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively.


# challenge5
This application focuses on to create a simple work day scheduler by using jQuery, Local Storage, and Moment.js r.
HTML and CSS are updated with the time as the user can do it in the page without changing anything on the js, with time blocks adjusting background color according to if the hour is in the past, present, or future.
User inputs calendar items into the text area, and clicking the Save button puts those items into Local Storage.
Calendar item is consistent with the data saved during updates in the page.

# Acceptance Criteria.
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule.

WHEN I open the planner.

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

WHEN I scroll down.

THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours.

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day.

THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

WHEN I click into a time block.

THEN I can enter an event.

WHEN I click the save button for that time block.

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage.

WHEN I refresh the page.

THEN the saved events persist.
