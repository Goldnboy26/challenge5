This application focuses on to create a simple work day scheduler by using jQuery, Local Storage, and Moment.js r.
HTML and CSS are updated with the time as the user can do it in the page without changing anything on the js, with time blocks adjusting background color according to if the hour is in the past, present, or future.
User inputs calendar items into the text area, and clicking the Save button puts those items into Local Storage.
Calendar item is consistent with the data saved during updates in the page.
